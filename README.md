# SparseInteractions
This repository contains the R and stan scripts necessary to recreate the analyses presented in the manuscript "Disentangling key species interactions in diverse and heterogeneous communities: A Bayesian sparse modeling approach". It is organized into two folders. "BH_simulations" holds all the scripts and simulated .csv files necessary for testing the models using data simulated according to a stochastic Beverton-Holt model of community dynamics. "Empirical" holds the data and scripts necessary to recreate the analyses on Waitzia acuminata and Arctotheca calendula from the Bendering and Perenjori nature reserves in southwest Australia. The "BH_simulations" folder is further subdivided into a "Main" folder with the scripts used for the analysis in the main paper, and "Box" with scripts for variations, including constant or environmentally varying alpha (species interactions) parameters and monotonic or optimum functions defining lambda (intrinsic growth rate).
